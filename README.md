Grocery list challenge.

We're creating a grocery list.

1. There should be a list of groceries.
2. Each grocery should have a name, category, quantity, and price.
3. A user can add or delete groceries.
4. When the same grocery is added or deleted, instead of adding it again, the quantity increments or decrements.
5. A user can clear the list.
