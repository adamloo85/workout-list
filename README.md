Push-ups | Chest | 20 | [X]\

Back-end
1. How would you model the database (users, workouts, workout list)?
2. How would you model the API?

Front-end
1. There should be a list of workout movements.
2. Each workout should have a name, category, quantity, completed.
3. A user can add or delete workouts.
4. When the same workout is added or deleted, instead of adding it again, the quantity increments or decrements.
5. A user can clear the workout list.
